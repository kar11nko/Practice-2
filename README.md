## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What We learned
We have learned how to use all these tools correctly. How to correctly prioritize when compiling a website. You can see important examples below.

Snippets:

```html
<<h2>Master</h2>
              <h3 class="monthly">&dollar;39.99</h3>
              <h4 class="annually">&dollar;399.99</h4><hr>
              <p>2 TB Storage</p><hr>
              <p>10 Users Allowed</p><hr>
              <p>Send up to 20 GB</p><hr>
              <button>Learn More</button>
```
```css
.button {
    width: 85%;
    margin : 1.5rem auto 0.5rem auto;
    padding: 0.8rem;
    cursor: pointer;
    font-size: 0.8rem;
    transition-duration: 3000;
    color:white;
    background-color: hsl(237, 63%, 64%);
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px; 
    text-transform: uppercase;
}

```
